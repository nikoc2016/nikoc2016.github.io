Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for developing a diverse variety of server tools and applications. Although Node.js is not a JavaScript framework,[4] many of its basic modules are written in JavaScript, and developers can write new modules in JavaScript. The runtime environment interprets JavaScript using Google's V8 JavaScript engine.
Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in Web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).[5]
The Node.js distributed development project, governed by the Node.js Foundation,[6] is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.[7]
Corporate users of Node.js software include GoDaddy,[8] Groupon,[9] IBM,[10] LinkedIn,[11][12] Microsoft,[13][14] Netflix,[15] PayPal,[16][17] Rakuten, SAP,[18] Voxer,[19] Walmart,[20] Yahoo!,[21] and Cisco Systems.

Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only.
Bootstrap is the second most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 107,000 stars and 48,000 forks.
